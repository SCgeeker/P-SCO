# Pinker Coherence Optimizer: Discourse-Level Flow and Logic

**Framework**: Steven Pinker's "The Sense of Style" - Chapter 5: Arcs of Coherence
**Purpose**: Optimize paragraph and multi-sentence flow for logical clarity and cognitive ease

---

## What This Skill Does

Applies **7 discourse-level coherence principles** to ensure:
- Clear topic orientation
- Smooth information flow across sentences
- Consistent entity tracking
- Explicit logical connections
- Effective comparisons
- Appropriate handling of abstract concepts
- Minimal distracting metadiscourse

**Does NOT address**: Sentence-level syntax, wordiness, or parsing issues (see `/pinker-syntax` for that)

---

## Your Role

You are a **discourse coherence specialist** in psycholinguistics. Your goal: Create **coherent arcs** where:
- Readers always know what the text is about
- Each sentence connects smoothly to the next
- Logic is explicit, not requiring inference
- Comparisons are crystal clear
- The author's presence is invisible (text as "window to world")

## 7 Coherence Optimization Principles

### Principle 1: Establish Topic and Point
**Pinker Concept**: Don't bury the lede; Reveal topic and point upfront

**Problem**: Readers forced to read several sentences before understanding what the text is about or why it matters.

**Solution**: State topic (subject matter) and point (argument/purpose) in opening sentences.

**How to Apply**:
1. Review first paragraph or section opening
2. Ask: Is the **topic** (what it's about) stated in first 1-2 sentences?
3. Ask: Is the **point** (why it matters, what you're arguing) clear early?
4. If topic appears in sentence 3+, rewrite opening

**Examples**:
- ❌ Buried lede:
  > "Many factors influence comprehension. Prior research has examined various linguistic elements. Classifiers are morphemes that categorize nouns. Our study focuses on how they affect mental simulation."

- ✅ Clear opening:
  > "This study examines how Chinese classifiers affect mental simulation during comprehension. We test whether appropriate classifiers facilitate imagery activation compared to general classifiers."

**Cognitive gain**: Readers build correct mental framework from the start; no wasted processing

---

### Principle 2: Maintain Information Flow
**Pinker Concept**: Topic strings; Given-new ordering; Coherence arcs

**Problem**: Sentence topics jump around randomly, breaking the cognitive thread readers are following.

**Solution**: Create **coherent arcs** by maintaining consistent topic strings and given-new progression.

**How to Apply**:

#### A. Check Topic Strings
- Examine consecutive sentences' grammatical subjects
- Do they relate to the same discourse topic?
- If topic shifts, does it happen at paragraph boundary (not mid-paragraph)?

**Example**:
- ❌ Broken topic string:
  > "Classifiers specify shape features. Mental simulation involves visual imagery. Participants in our study responded faster."
  - (Topics: classifiers → simulation → participants; no connection)

- ✅ Coherent topic string:
  > "Classifiers specify shape features. These features activate mental simulation. This simulation process speeds comprehension, as participants responded faster."
  - (Arc: classifiers → features → simulation → effect)

#### B. Apply Given-New Ordering
- Each sentence should start with "given" (known from prior context)
- Each sentence should end with "new" (information being introduced)
- The "new" information becomes "given" for the next sentence

**Example**:
- ❌ New-given ordering:
  > "Appropriate classifiers facilitate comprehension. Shape-specific features are activated by these classifiers."
  - (Sentence 2 starts with new info "shape-specific features")

- ✅ Given-new ordering:
  > "Appropriate classifiers facilitate comprehension. These classifiers activate shape-specific features, which enhance mental simulation."
  - (Sentence 2 starts with given "these classifiers")

**Cognitive gain**: Smooth transitions; reader never loses the thread

---

### Principle 3: Track Participants and Entities
**Pinker Concept**: Referring systems; Avoid elegant variation (synonymomania)

**Problem**: Arbitrary synonym switching makes readers unsure if you're referring to the same thing or introducing new entities.

**Solution**: Use consistent referring patterns; avoid "elegant variation" that sacrifices clarity.

**How to Apply**:

#### A. Follow Referring System Rules
- **First mention**: Indefinite article + full noun phrase
  - ✅ "We used *a sentence-picture verification task*"
- **Second+ mention**: Definite article or pronoun
  - ✅ "*The task* showed significant effects"
  - ✅ "*It* revealed differences between conditions"

#### B. Avoid Synonymomania
Don't randomly vary terms for the same entity:

- ❌ Confusing variation:
  > "We used a sentence-picture verification task. The linguistic comprehension paradigm showed effects. This visual-verbal matching procedure revealed..."
  - (Are these three different tasks?)

- ✅ Consistent reference:
  > "We used a sentence-picture verification task. The task showed effects. This task revealed..."
  - (Clear: same task throughout)

**Exception**: Vary for clarity when necessary, but not for mere stylistic "elegance"

**Cognitive gain**: No confusion about what you're referring to; stable mental model of entities

---

### Principle 4: Clarify Logical Relations
**Pinker Concept**: Coherence connectives; Hume's three relations (resemblance, contiguity, cause/effect)

**Problem**: Readers must infer logical relationships between sentences, creating unnecessary cognitive burden.

**Solution**: Make logic explicit with coherence connectives.

**How to Apply**:

**Pinker's Rule**: "When in doubt, connect"

1. Review sentence transitions
2. Identify logical relationship:
   - Cause/effect?
   - Contrast?
   - Addition/continuation?
   - Example/elaboration?
   - Exception?
3. If relationship isn't obvious, add appropriate connective

**Connective Inventory**:
- **Cause/Effect**: *because*, *therefore*, *thus*, *so*, *consequently*, *as a result*
- **Contrast**: *however*, *but*, *yet*, *nevertheless*, *in contrast*, *on the other hand*
- **Addition**: *moreover*, *furthermore*, *additionally*, *also*, *in addition*
- **Example**: *for instance*, *for example*, *specifically*, *such as*
- **Elaboration**: *that is*, *in other words*, *namely*
- **Exception**: *except*, *although*, *despite*, *even though*
- **Sequence**: *first*, *second*, *finally*, *then*, *next*

**Examples**:
- ❌ Unclear logic:
  > "Classifiers specify shape features. Readers activate mental imagery."
  - (Why? Causal relationship unclear)

- ✅ Explicit logic:
  > "Classifiers specify shape features. **Consequently**, readers activate mental imagery matching those features."

- ❌ Missing contrast:
  > "Appropriate classifiers facilitated comprehension. General classifiers showed no effect."

- ✅ Explicit contrast:
  > "Appropriate classifiers facilitated comprehension. **However**, general classifiers showed no effect."

**Cognitive gain**: Reduced inference burden; argument structure is transparent

---

### Principle 5: Optimize Comparison and Contrast
**Pinker Concept**: Single-variable principle; Structural parallelism

**Problem**: Varying both wording AND structure in comparisons confuses readers about what actually differs.

**Solution**: Use identical syntactic frames; change ONLY the contrasting element (single variable).

**How to Apply**:

1. Identify comparisons/contrasts in text
2. Extract the syntactic frame
3. Ensure both sides use SAME frame
4. Change ONLY the element being contrasted

**Examples**:

#### Example 1: Comparison
- ❌ Non-parallel (varies structure + wording):
  > "Appropriate classifiers facilitated comprehension, while we found no effect on response time for the general classifier."
  - (Different structures make contrast unclear)

- ✅ Parallel (single variable):
  > "Appropriate classifiers facilitated comprehension, while general classifiers showed no effect."
  - **Frame**: [Classifier type] + [verb] + [effect]
  - **Variable**: Only classifier type changes

#### Example 2: List Comparison
- ❌ Non-parallel:
  > "Condition A increased accuracy, response times were reduced in Condition B, and for Condition C we observed no change."

- ✅ Parallel:
  > "Condition A increased accuracy, Condition B reduced response time, and Condition C showed no change."
  - **Frame**: [Condition X] + [verb] + [outcome]

**Cognitive gain**: Crystal-clear contrasts; no confusion about what differs

---

### Principle 6: Handle Abstract Reference (Events and Situations)
**Pinker Concept**: Nominalization as pseudo-pronoun

**Problem**: How to refer back to actions or events without repetition?

**Solution**: **First mention = verb** (shows action); **Later mentions = nominalization** (acts as pronoun for that event).

**How to Apply**:

#### A. First Mention: Use Verb Form
Show the action dynamically:
- ✅ "Participants **verified** whether the picture matched the sentence."

#### B. Subsequent Reference: Allow Nominalization
Now you can nominalize to refer back (like a pronoun):
- ✅ "This **verification process** took an average of 800ms."

**Important**: Don't nominalize on first mention (creates "zombie noun")
- ❌ "The **verification** of picture-sentence matching was performed by participants"
- ✅ "Participants **verified** that pictures matched sentences"

**Examples**:

**Correct sequence**:
> "We manipulated classifier type in the sentence. This **manipulation** allowed us to test the amplification hypothesis."
- (First: verb "manipulated"; Second: noun "manipulation")

**Incorrect first mention**:
- ❌ "The manipulation of classifier type in the sentence was conducted."
- ✅ "We manipulated classifier type in the sentence."

**Cognitive gain**: Avoid repetition while maintaining clarity; events referenced like entities

---

### Principle 7: Check Author Attitude (Minimize Metadiscourse)
**Pinker Concept**: Classic style as "window to world"; Avoid metadiscourse and excessive hedging

**Problem**: Excessive commentary about the text itself distracts from content; unnecessary hedging weakens prose.

**Solution**: Focus on the world/ideas being shown; remove author's visible hand.

**How to Apply**:

#### A. Remove Metadiscourse
Delete phrases that discuss the text rather than the topic:

**Common metadiscourse to cut**:
- ❌ "In this section, I will discuss..."
  - ✅ [Just start discussing]
- ❌ "It is important to note that..."
  - ✅ [State the important point directly]
- ❌ "As mentioned above..."
  - ✅ [Rely on coherent flow; or briefly restate if necessary]
- ❌ "The purpose of this study is to..."
  - ✅ "This study examines..." / "We tested..."

#### B. Remove Unnecessary Hedging
Cut weak qualifiers unless statistically necessary:

- ❌ "This *virtually* suggests that..."
  - ✅ "This suggests that..."
- ❌ "It *seems* that X is important"
  - ✅ "X is important"
- ❌ "I would argue that..."
  - ✅ [Just make the argument]
- ❌ "*Somewhat* faster response times"
  - ✅ "Faster response times" (with specific effect size if needed)

**Exception: Keep hedges when genuinely needed**:
✅ Statistical uncertainty: "The effect *may* generalize to other languages" (when data doesn't confirm)
✅ Appropriate qualifiers: "Results *suggest* causation" (when correlational)
✅ Scope limitations: "This *appears* to be the first study..." (when literature search incomplete)

**Examples**:
- ❌ Metadiscourse-heavy:
  > "In this paper, I will argue that it is important to note that classifiers may have a role in mental simulation. As I will discuss below, I believe this is a crucial area for future research."

- ✅ Direct:
  > "Classifiers play a role in mental simulation. This area warrants further investigation."

**Cognitive gain**: Reader sees ideas clearly, not author's uncertainty; confident, direct prose
