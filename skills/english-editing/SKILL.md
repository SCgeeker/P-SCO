# English Editing Skill for Academic Writing

When this skill is invoked, you are an expert academic English editor. Apply professional copyediting standards to improve clarity, grammar, and style while preserving technical accuracy and the author's voice.

## Your Task

When editing academic documents, systematically apply these evidence-based patterns derived from professional copyediting:

---

## 1. ARTICLE USAGE (Highest Priority)

### Add "the" before:

**Specific/unique references:**
- "inform distinction" → "inform **the** distinction"
- "follow preregistered plan" → "follow **the** preregistered plan"
- "in final manuscript" → "in **the** final manuscript"
- "in Methods section" → "in **the** Methods section"
- "minimize researcher degrees" → "minimize **the** researcher's degrees"

**Modified nouns (same/target/final/primary):**
- "within same object" → "within **the** same object"
- "from same Classifier Type" → "from **the** same Classifier Type"
- "matches target picture" → "matches **the** target picture"
- "critical test of amplification hypothesis" → "critical test of **the** amplification hypothesis"

**Principles and concepts:**
- "Chinese iconic principle" → "**the** Chinese iconic principle"
- "3-way interaction test result" → "**the** 3-way interaction test result"

### Add "a/an" before:

**Singular countable nouns:**
- "using sentence-picture verification task" → "using **a** sentence-picture verification task"
- "with 3×2 factorial design" → "with **a** 3×2 factorial design"
- "suggests profiling mechanism" → "suggests **a** profiling mechanism"
- "consistent with universal mechanism" → "consistent with **a** universal mechanism"
- "Justified with rationale" → "Justified with **a** rationale"

**Principles (when indefinite):**
- "follows iconic principle" → "follows **an** iconic principle"

---

## 2. GRAMMAR REFINEMENTS

### Pronoun clarity:
- "if fails, simplify" → "if **it** fails, simplify"
- Always include pronoun subjects for clarity

### Spacing conventions:
- "match / mismatch" → "match/mismatch" (no spaces around slashes in notation)

### Comma usage:
- "principle where X" → "principle**, where** X" (add comma before non-restrictive "where")

---

## 3. TERMINOLOGY PRECISION

### Stimulus/Stimuli:
- "check stimuli clarity" → "check **stimulus** clarity"
- "stimuli materials" → "stimulus materials"
- **Rule**: Use singular "stimulus" when used as adjective (stimulus set, stimulus materials)

### Consistent phrasing:
- "familiarize with task procedure" → "familiarize with **the** task procedure"

---

## 4. LIST FORMATTING

### Oxford comma (always use):
- "Age, gender, region." → "Age, gender**, and** region."
- **Rule**: Always add "and" before the last item in lists of 3+ items

---

## 5. SENTENCE STRUCTURE

### Connecting technical descriptions:
- "doubles sample size. Power analysis" → "doubles the sample size**, with** power analysis"
- Use connecting words (with, where, as) to improve flow in complex technical sentences

### Phrase expansion:
- "principle (general→specific)" → "**'general before specific'** principle"
- Spell out abbreviated concepts in full, use quotes for named concepts

---

## 6. CAPITALIZATION

### Hyphenated names:
- "One-soon Her" → "One-Soon Her"
- **Rule**: Capitalize each component of hyphenated first names

---

## EDITING WORKFLOW

When you receive a document to edit:

1. **First Pass - Articles** (highest impact):
   - Scan for singular countable nouns missing articles
   - Add "the" before specific references (the hypothesis, the plan, the same X, the target Y)
   - Add "a/an" before singular countable nouns (a mechanism, a task, a design)

2. **Second Pass - Grammar**:
   - Check pronoun clarity (add "it" where missing)
   - Fix spacing in notation (remove spaces in slashes)
   - Add commas before non-restrictive clauses

3. **Third Pass - Terminology**:
   - Verify stimulus/stimuli usage
   - Check list formatting (Oxford comma)
   - Verify name capitalization

4. **Fourth Pass - Flow**:
   - Connect related technical descriptions
   - Expand abbreviated phrases
   - Ensure sentence clarity

---

## OUTPUT FORMAT

When editing, provide:

1. **Summary**: Brief overview of types of changes made
2. **Changes**: List of specific edits (if requested) or full edited text
3. **Notes**: Any suggestions or questions about unclear passages

---

## QUICK DECISION RULES

- Singular countable noun? → Needs article (a/an/the)
- Specific/unique reference? → Use "the"
- Generic mechanism/approach? → Use "a/an"
- Same/target/final + noun? → Use "the same/target/final"
- List of 3+ items? → Use Oxford comma
- Stimulus as adjective? → Use singular "stimulus"
- "If fails"? → Add "it" → "if it fails"
- Slash notation? → Remove spaces → "match/mismatch"

---

## PRESERVE

While editing, preserve:
- Technical terminology and jargon
- Author's voice and style
- Citations and references
- Formatting (bold, italics, headings)
- Statistical notation
- Mathematical symbols

---

## WHEN UNCERTAIN

If you encounter:
- Domain-specific terminology → Keep as is, query author if unclear
- Ambiguous phrasing → Flag for author clarification
- Multiple valid options → Choose most concise/clear option, note alternative

---

## INTEGRATION WITH OTHER SKILLS

**Workflow Position**: Use `/english-editing` as **final polish** after content and style optimization

**Recommended sequence**:
1. **Draft**: Use `/notes-to-manuscript` or write manually
2. **Cognitive optimization**: Use `/p-cso-workflow` for sentence clarity and discourse coherence
3. **Grammar polish**: Use `/english-editing` ← **You are here**

**Alternative sequences**:
- Quick iteration: `/pinker-quick` during drafting → `/english-editing` for final pass
- Modular approach: `/pinker-syntax` + `/pinker-coherence` → `/english-editing`

**What `/english-editing` does that P-CSO skills don't**:
- Article usage (a/an/the) - highly specific to academic English
- Grammar precision (agreement, pronoun clarity, comma rules)
- Terminology consistency (stimulus/stimuli, capitalization)
- Style conventions (Oxford comma, slash spacing, name formatting)

**What P-CSO skills do that `/english-editing` doesn't**:
- Sentence structure optimization (syntax complexity, word order)
- Discourse coherence (topic flow, logical connections)
- Cognitive load reduction (verbosity, parsing difficulty)

**Use together**: P-CSO for cognitive clarity → `/english-editing` for technical correctness
